TODO intro text

### 📄 Andrew Hao - Pitfalls to avoid when moving to async systems

> A great article for people that are considering or starting to add more asynchronicity to their system \(if that applies to you, feel free to get in touch with StyleLounge, we're happy to talk about our experiences with it 🙂\)

### 🗣 Ryan Dahl - The idea behind node.js: Callback-based asynchronicity & the event loop

> As relevant to node.js developers as to everybody else. Ryan explains the motivation behind the asynchronicity model of node.js and explains the conceptual problems with traditional thread-based models.

### 🗣 Uwe Friedrichsen – Resilient functional service design

> By the way: Uwe gave many great talks, one gem if you want to deep-dive into consistency is “[Real-world consistency explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG3xKyldSK0)”

### 🗣 Adrian Cockroft – Migrating to Microservices

> Definitely on of the better “migrating to microservices” talks. It gives a great overview and - most importantly - explains the reasoning behind architectural decisions.

### 📄 Gene Hughson - Boundaries, Governance, Reuse & Complexity

> Great post that contains lots of links

### 📄 Martin Kleppmann - Turning the db inside out with Apache Samza

> Although this post is about Apache Samza, a stream processing framework, this article is a seriously great deep dive into databases and distributed non ACID-systems.
